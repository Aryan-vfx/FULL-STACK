Dynamic Product Filter

A web-based dropdown that allows users to filter products based on categories (like Electronics, Clothing, Books, etc.).
The product list updates instantly without reloading the page.

JavaScript Logic

const products = […]

Stores all product data as an array of objects.

Each object has two properties: name and category.

Example: { name: "Shirt", category: "Clothing" }.

This acts as the main dataset for filtering.

function displayProducts(filteredProducts)

Takes the filtered list as input.

Clears the existing product list.

Loops through filteredProducts and dynamically creates <li> items.

Updates the page instantly with the new list.

document.getElementById("filter")

Selects the <select> dropdown element from HTML.

Allows JavaScript to know which filter option is selected.

filter.addEventListener("change", … )

Detects when the user changes the category.

Runs the filtering logic immediately.

Ensures displayed products match the selected option.

const filteredProducts = products.filter(…)

Uses the .filter() method to create a subset of products.

If Clothing is selected → only products with category === "Clothing" are shown.

If All is chosen → displays the entire product list.

productList.appendChild(li)

Appends each product (as an <li> element) to the product list.

Visually updates the page with the new results.
